## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this challenge, I learned about the <hr> tag, how to create a coloured overlay for an image, and how to overlay an image over another. 

### Continued development

In the future, I wish to continue to learn how to best space out elements of the components on sites using methods such as padding, margin, or gaps. A fair amount of time during this challenge was spent trying to work out the gaps between each of the elements, and while I believe this issue could have been remedied by accessing the original Figma designs for the proper dimensions, I also believe there must be an easier way to do spacing, whether it is using a particular CSS attribute, or simply becoming better at judging with my own eyes. 

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - This tutorial was exactly what was required to be able to get the primary image overlay to work, with the coloured background and icon placed on top.
